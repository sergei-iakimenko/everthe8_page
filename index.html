    let me hear your lullaby...
    let me hear your lullaby...
    let me hear your...
    let me hear your lullaby

    Trippin' all night, now It feels like all a blur,
    Love the way you lull, when you run your fingers through my curls,
    Now and then you miss it, now and then it makes you hurt
    i love the way sing alone, runnin’ your fingers through my curls

    Blu blur, all a blur
    Blu blur, all a blur
    Blu blur, all a blur
    Blu blur, all a blur

    let me hear your lullaby
    let me hear your lullaby
    let me hear your lullaby
    let me hear your lullaby

    i want u stay with me tonight
    i want u stay with me tonight
    i want u stay with me tonight
    i want u stay with me tonight

    I’m bout to lose my self control
    i’m bout to lose my peace of mind
    ever since your heart turned to stone
    ever since you left my side

    ever since you left my side
    i just kept moving quiet
    should i forget about the past
    tell me what you feel inside

    i now that you have new guy
    don’t tell me about it let’s just keep it private
    don’t u forget about the past
    tell me what you feel inside

    girl let’s just keep it private
    sing me your lullaby
    i want u stay with me tonight
    i want u stay with me tonight

    i’m bout to lose my peace of mind
    i’m bout to lose my self control
    i’m bout to lose my peace of mind
    i’m bout to lose my self control
    ever since you left my side
    ever since you left my side
    i just kept moving quiet
    I just kept moving quiet
    should i forget about the past
    tell me what you feel inside
